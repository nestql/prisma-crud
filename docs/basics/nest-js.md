## `typegraphql-nestjs`

In order to use generated types and resolvers classes in NestJS, you need to use the [official `typegraphql-nestjs` package](https://github.com/MichalLytek/typegraphql-nestjs).

This module allows for basic integration of TypeGraphQL with NestJS, so you can use the generated TypeGraphQL classes to create a GraphQL API in NestJS.

You can find an example in the [`examples/4-nest-js` folder](https://github.com/nestql/prisma-crud/tree/main/examples/4-nest-js).

:::caution
Due to difference between TypeGraphQL and NestJS decorators, `typegraphql-prisma` doesn't work anymore with `@nestjs/graphql` from version 7.0.
