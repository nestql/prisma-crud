# @nestjs/graphql & prisma integration

Prisma generator to emit `@nestjs/graphql` types and CRUD resolvers from your `Prisma` schema.

## Documentation

The documentation, installation guide, detailed description of the API and all of its features is [available on the website](https://prisma.typegraphql.com/).

## Examples

You can check out some usage examples on this repo:

https://github.com/nestql/prisma-crud/blob/main/examples/Readme.md

## Future plans

In some far feature, when Prisma SDK will be ready, the `typegraphql-prisma` integration will also allow to use a code-first approach to build a `schema.prisma` and GraphQL schema at once, using classes with decorators as a single source of truth.

Stay tuned! :muscle:
